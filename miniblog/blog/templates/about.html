    <p>Bootstrap Icons are designed to work best with Bootstrap components, but they’ll work in any project. They’re SVGs, so they scale quickly and easily, can be implemented in several ways, and can be styled with CSS.</p>
    <p>Themes are built on Bootstrap as their own extended frameworks, rich with new components and plugins, documentation, and powerful build tools.
